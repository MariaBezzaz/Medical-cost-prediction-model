This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting medical costs based on various personal attributes such as age, BMI, and smoking status. Using a dataset of medical insurance costs, several regression models are trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate predictor of medical expenses. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation, all implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
